# BDD
# Given n is an integer, the method sum_terms should return the sum of the first n terms of an 
# arithmetico-geometric series

# Pseudocode
# 1. Create a range object from 1 to n
# 2. Calculate the nth term of the arithmetico-geometric series using the formula (n^2 + n)/2
# 3. Return the sum of all terms by using the reduce method and summing each term

# Test case provided
